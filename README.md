# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project is aimed at analyzing text to detect the sentiment behind words and phrases. By examining various texts, we aim to identify and categorize the emotions expressed.

## Data

We utilize two main types of data:

- Text excerpts from speeches and writings that provide a rich context for sentiment analysis.
- A mapping of words to their corresponding emotions to aid in the detection of sentiment.

## Methodology

The core of our analysis lies in the `naive_linechunk` algorithm, which processes the text and assigns sentiment based on the emotions dictionary.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [attreyabhatt/Sentiment-Analysis](https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Sentiment-Analysis). It has been modified and adapted to our specific use-case and research questions.

## Installation

To set up the necessary environment for this project, you need to install the requirements. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We welcome contributions and improvements to the algorithm and the emotions dictionary. Please feel free to submit pull requests.
